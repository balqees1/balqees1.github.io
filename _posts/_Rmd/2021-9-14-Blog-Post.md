## SAS vs R

I have used SAS in my job and R while taking the continuing education courses at NCSU. I can't say that I know SAS in details but I would prefer SAS over R due to the following reasons. First reason is obvious. I am more comfortable in using SAS than R because of my experience. Second in my opinion SaS is way easier to learn as compared with R. Today's home work is a good example. I have spent at least three hours trying to figure out why my image is not showing in my output but no success. I trust SAS because it is a commercial product in R whereas R is open source. Writing loops in R has always been an issue for me. I have taken many classes at NCSU thst used R but for most classes R code was provided by the teacher. Therefore, I never learned it. This classes is giving me an opportunity to learn R and it is testing me.

## Including Plots

```{r irisplot, echo=TRUE,eval = TRUE}

```
