I did not have firsthand knowledge of duties and responsibilities of a data scientist before as I have never worked as a data scientist. I work as a statistician. The recommended articles gave me an idea about the differences in job description of a data scientist and a statistician. Before I say something about the differences, I would point out that there are many similarities between the two professions. Both statisticians and data scientists have to be good at math and computer skills and have to analyze data to come up with answers of the clients’ questions, so that they can make data driven informed decisions.  The main difference in my opinion is that statisticians worry more about capturing the variability in the data and making sure that the model assumptions are met while choosing one best model, whereas the data scientists try to come up with best predictive model by comparing different methods and using machine learning tools. A data scientist should have a solid foundation in statistics but need not to be the expert on deep technical issues.  Also, it appears that typically statisticians work with relatively smaller data sets as compared with data scientists. A data scientist’s job is more challenging in the sense that he/she deals with tons of messy data and have to spend a lot of time in cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
